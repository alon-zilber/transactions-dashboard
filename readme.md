Welcome to the interview process for the Full-Stack Developer position at our company!

Task: Building a Basic Dashboard for the Finances Team
-

As a user, you need to see a rich dashboard of your transactions. Your task is to build a table for transactions with the following requirements:

1. The table should include the following columns:
- account_uuid
- organization_uuid
- currency
- status (processed/submitted)
- is_temporary
- type
- is_money_in
- day
- total_amount
- total_amount_in_use
- transactions_count

2. The table should include a pagination mechanism **
3. Clicking on any column header should sort the data by that parameter - ascending/descending **
4. The is_temporary property can be changed from false to true in the expended view (delete functionality)

** Implement without using any pre-built UI component library

Bonus:
-
- Ensure the comments and transaction modifications are preserved even after refreshing the page.
- Responsive UI
- Implement any additional cool features that you think will be helpful for the finance team

Additional Requirements:
-
1. Use modern React practices and principles to create the application.
2. Your code should be maintainable, scalable, and readable.

Before You Start:
-
- You are free to use any styling library such as Tailwind CSS, Emotion, Styled Components, or just plain CSS
- You can use pre-built UI component libraries but try to implement some UI components on your own as well.
- You can refer to the PNG file located in the /public directory. In the same directory is also the data for the task.

We wish you the best of luck!
